This is Thistle's main game and is a 2D platform concept. We have a variety of concept interactions. A few of the levels were designed. This was just dipping my toes into animations and colliders in unity. Right now this concept only supports jumping, walking, left and right movement. This also utilizes 2d colliders to interact with the walls of the game and the objects in the scene.
